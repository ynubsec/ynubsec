# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

I take security seriously across all my research projects, tools, and repositories. This policy outlines my commitment to security and responsible disclosure practices.

## 🔐 Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest stable versions of my projects:

| Version Status | Support Level | Update Policy |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Latest**     | ✅ Full Support | Immediate security patches |
| **Previous**   | ⚠️ Limited Support | Critical security fixes only |
| **Old**        | ❌ No Support | No security updates |

## 🐛 Reporting Security Issues

### How to Report

**Preferred Method:** Send an encrypted report to **ynubsec@gmail.com**

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:

- **Vulnerability Details**: Clear description of the security issue
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Environment**: Operating system, versions, and configuration
- **Exploitation Difficulty**: Level of expertise required to exploit
- **Proof of Concept**: If available, without active exploitation

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Acknowledgment** | Within 48 hours | Confirm receipt of your report |
| **Initial Analysis** | 3-5 business days | Preliminary assessment and validation |
| **Coordination** | Ongoing | Discussion of timeline and approach |
| **Resolution** | Varies | Development and testing of fix |
| **Public Disclosure** | Coordinated | Joint announcement with researcher |

## 🔍 Scope of Security Research

### In-Scope Activities

- Testing your own systems and networks
- Research on publicly available test environments
- Academic security research with proper authorization
- Bug bounty programs and authorized penetration testing
- Security tool development and testing in controlled environments
- Cryptographic analysis of publicly available implementations
- Protocol security analysis with appropriate permissions
- Memory safety research in research environments
- Reverse engineering for security research purposes
- Vulnerability analysis with proper disclosure procedures

### Out-of-Scope Activities

- **Unauthorized Testing**: Any testing of systems without explicit permission
- **Malicious Activity**: Intentional disruption of services or data
- **Privacy Violations**: Accessing or attempting to access private user data
- **Commercial Exploitation**: Using discovered vulnerabilities for financial gain
- **Network Attacks**: DDoS attacks, network scanning without permission
- **Social Engineering**: Attempting to trick users into compromising security
- **Malware Development**: Creating or distributing malicious software
- **Chain Exploitation**: Using one vulnerability to discover unrelated issues

## 📋 Security Best Practices

### For Users and Contributors
- Keep systems and dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Use proper authentication and access controls
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
- Secure coding practices and input validation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Minimal privilege principles
- Secure configuration management

### For Research Collaboration
- Sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) when required
- Use secure communication channels for sensitive information
- Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure timelines
- Respect proprietary and confidential information
- Provide adequate testing time for patches
- Maintain detailed research documentation

## 🔧 Security Tools Development

### Tool Security Requirements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Proper access control and authentication
- Secure communication (TLS/SSL when applicable)
- Minimal privilege operation
- Secure temporary file handling
- Proper session management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Development Security
- Static code analysis and security scanning
- Dependency security monitoring
- Secure build processes
- Code signing and integrity verification
- Security-focused testing and QA
- Regular security reviews and audits

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Compliance
- Follow applicable local and international laws
- Respect digital property rights and intellectual property
- Adhere to responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with export control regulations
- Follow privacy protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

### Authorization Requirements
- Obtain written permission before testing any system
- Ensure proper contractual agreements for commercial testing
- Understand scope limitations and boundaries
- Respect terms of service and acceptable use policies
- Document authorization for all testing activities

## 🎯 Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Vulnerability Prevention**: Building secure systems from the ground up
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Proper coordination with affected parties
- **Security Education**: Sharing knowledge to improve overall security
- **Research Integrity**: Maintaining high ethical standards in security research
- **Community Protection**: Ensuring research benefits the security community

### Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required access levels
- **Secure by Default**: Safe configurations out of the box
- **Fail Secure**: Systems remain secure even during failures
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protection measures

## 📞 Contact Information

### Security Inquiries
**Primary Contact**: ynubsec@gmail.com
**Encryption Preferred**: PGP/GPG encryption for sensitive communications
**Response Time**: 48 hours for initial acknowledgment

### Emergency Contact
